      <p> Dominican Republic is one of the most beautiful places to ever go... I had never experienced something so peaceful like DR. Me and my girlfriend stood over there for about a month, and we never wanted to leave. We needed this vacation to get away from stress because it can get you up to a point where you just want to not do anything at all. Always follow your heart, and always make the right decisions in life, because your heart might be telling you something that you should do... </p>
