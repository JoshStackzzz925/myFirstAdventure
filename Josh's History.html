      <p> Josh wasn't really a good kid when it came to all his studies... He wanted to always become a better person, and do the best he can to make all his dreams come true... In order to do that, he needed a break to clear up his mind, and reorganize himself physically & mentally. He decided to take a trip to the Dominican Republic with his girlfriend, and spend his time relaxing, and having fun... In life, it's always a great idea to not stress yourself out too much, do what your heart desires, and you'll see how great of a person you really are. When the time was right, Josh got right back to studies in his hometown, New York, and averaged a 3.8 GPA.</p>
